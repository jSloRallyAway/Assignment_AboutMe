Assignment:

This assignment will be the finished and polished version of what you've been working on so far! You already started your "About Me" and "Images" pages of your personal website. Now it is time to polish those two and add one more! This third page will be your choice. You can create a blog page, contact me page or something else that inspires you. It should carry over the same style choices you made in the first two pages. Make sure you add navigation links so that you can navigate to and from each page easily. The final product will be your first website!

The other part of this assignment is to utilize git as you work. From start to finish you should be making multiple commits. Think about if you've ever had to write a long paper, as you wrote you would reach points and think "this is a good place to save". Continue that thinking with this project. As you write HTML/CSS be sure to "save" your work with git and GitHub.

Grading criteria:

HTML/CSS is formatted and linked properly
At least one additional content page is added
About Me page has updated styling
6-10 commits showing progress
GitHub repository is properly set up
All files are in one project folder
All pages are linked to navigate back and forth
